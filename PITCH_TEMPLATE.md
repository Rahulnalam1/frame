# Frame Demo Video - Pitch Template

## Opening Hook (5-10 seconds)
"Developers can't build apps on video content because there's no infrastructure to extract what's inside. Frame fixes this."

---

## Problem Setup (15-20 seconds)
"Right now, if you want to build an app that needs to understand what's in a video—like a learning platform that recommends content, or a tool that finds products in videos—you're stuck. You'd need to build your own video processing pipeline, mess with transcription APIs, run computer vision models... it's a nightmare.

We built Frame to make video content as easy to work with as text."

---

## Demo: Adding URLs (30-45 seconds)

### [Screen: Frame homepage with table]
"Here's how it works. You give us a YouTube URL..."

### [Action: Paste URL in first row]
"...and within 90 seconds, Frame analyzes the entire video."

### [Show table populating with data]
"We extract:
- The full transcript
- Key topics and themes
- Products mentioned
- Scene changes
- Important moments

All returned as clean JSON through our API."

### [Action: Add 2-3 more videos quickly]
"And it scales. Add as many videos as you want. Each one gets processed and ready to query in under 2 minutes."

---

## Demo: Checking the Docs (20-30 seconds)

### [Navigate to /docs page]
"For developers, we've made this dead simple to integrate."

### [Scroll through docs]
"POST a video URL to our API, get back a structured response with everything you need:
- Transcript with timestamps
- Topic extraction
- Product detection
- Key moments

Everything you'd want to build on top of video content, accessible through one API call."

---

## Demo: Dashboard (30-40 seconds)

### [Navigate to /dashboard page]
"And here's where it gets interesting. Our dashboard shows content gap analysis."

### [Show pie chart]
"We cluster your videos by content patterns and show you what's missing."

### [Point to content gaps section]
"See these red sections? These are content gaps—topics your audience wants but you're not covering. 

And here—over-represented content. You're making too much of this, time to diversify."

### [Scroll to recommendations]
"We even give you AI-powered recommendations on what to create next. It's like having a content strategist analyzing your entire library."

---

## Traction (10-15 seconds)

### [Navigate to /waitlist page]
"We walked around campus with this demo. 64 people signed up in one day.

Turns out, everyone building on video content has this same problem."

---

## Closing (10-15 seconds)
"Frame is Stripe for video intelligence. Send us a URL, get back JSON. Simple as that.

We're turning video content into an API."

---

## Total Time: ~2-3 minutes

## Pro Tips for Recording:

1. **Keep it moving** - Don't linger on any screen for more than 5 seconds
2. **Show, don't tell** - Let the UI speak for itself when possible
3. **Energy** - Sound excited about the traction (64 signups)
4. **Smooth transitions** - Practice moving between pages fluidly
5. **End strong** - The "Stripe for video intelligence" line is your money shot

## Screen Recording Flow:
1. Start on homepage (table empty)
2. Add first URL → watch it populate
3. Add 2-3 more URLs quickly (speed up footage 2x if needed)
4. Navigate to docs → scroll through API examples
5. Navigate to dashboard → show insights
6. Navigate to waitlist → mention 64 signups
7. Back to homepage or docs for final call-to-action

## Alternative Shorter Version (60 seconds):

"Video content is locked away. Developers can't build on it without building their own infrastructure.

[Show adding URL]
Frame changes that. Drop in a URL, get back JSON with transcript, topics, products, and key moments in 90 seconds.

[Show docs]
One API call. That's it.

[Show dashboard]
We even analyze your content library and tell you what gaps exist and what to make next.

[Show waitlist]
We walked around campus with this. 64 signups in a day. Everyone building on video has this problem.

Frame is Stripe for video intelligence. We're turning video content into an API."
